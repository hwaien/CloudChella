  "profile": "Ferry Aid were a British-American ensemble group, brought together to record the song \"Let It Be\" in 1987.\r\nThe single was released following the Zeebrugge Disaster, which had occurred on 6 March 1987 involving the capsizing of the MS Herald of Free Enterprise ferry, which killed 193 passengers and crew. All proceeds from sales of the single were donated to the charity set up in the aftermath of the disaster. The recording was organized by The Sun newspaper, after they had sold cheap tickets for the ferry on that day.\r\n\"Let It Be\" was written by Lennon/McCartney and originally recorded by The Beatles in 1969.\n",
