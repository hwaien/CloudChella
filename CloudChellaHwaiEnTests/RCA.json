  "profile": "Also appears as \"RCA Records\" or \"RCA Record\" (Australia/New Zealand).\r\nConsider adding [l=RCA Victor] as 2nd label if it also appears on the release.\r\nRCA is a record label that is used worldwide and operated by Sony Music Entertainment.\r\nThe change of logo occurred in 1967.\r\n\r\nLabel code: LC 0316 or LC 00316\r\n\r\nThe name RCA refers back to the [l=Radio Corporation of America] (RCA), a US company that existed in the 20th century. In 1929 this company entered the music business when it acquired the Victor Talking Machine Company. The Victor Talking Machine Company had released records on the Victor label until then.\r\nWith RCA Victor being the main label of the new business, RCA wasn't widely used as a label brand until the 1950s.\r\n\r\nIn 1985 the RCA label became part of RCA/Ariola International. One year later Bertelsmann (Ariola's owner) acquired 100% of RCA from General Electric and created the [l=Bertelsmann Music Group].\r\n\r\nSince then, the RCA label has switched owners twice. First it became a label of Sony BMG Music Entertainment and nowadays it's one of Sony Music Entertainment's labels.\r\n\r\nNote: even though Sony Music Entertainment owns the label, it doesn't own the RCA trademark. The RCA trademark is owned by a French company called Technicolor S.A. and licensed to Sony Music Entertainment by RCA Trademark Management S.A.\r\n\r\nAlso has a serie of Spanish releases called [L=Serie Discoteca (2)]\r\n\r\nWhen there is a 'RCA Editeur' mention (on 70's-80's French releases), please add [l895] as Record Company.",
